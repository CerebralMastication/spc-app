# Shiny in Production 

This repository contains code to support the 2019 rstudio::conf Shiny in Production workshop.

A rough directory structure is:


`app.R`: The primary application
 - `use_models.R`: Supporting function that enables the models used by the app
 - `*.RDS`: Saved models used by the app
 - `config.yml`: Specifies the database connection info used by the app

`tests`: Contains tests for the app (to be covered in the course)

`runloadtest.R`: File that walks through the load testing exercises (to be covered in the class)

`answers`: Contains supporting code / outputs to be generated by the course exercises

`alternatives`: Code showing how our app code be reimplemented as a report or re-architected to use an API

`generate_fake_student_data`: Contains the code used to generate the fake data and model

`provision`:  Contains information about the package environment used for the course

Finally, `Shiny in Production.pdf` contains the course slides.
