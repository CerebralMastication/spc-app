# Shiny in Production 

This repository contains code to support the 2019 rstudio::conf Shiny in Production workshop.

A rough directory structure is:


app.R  - The primary application
 - use_models.R - Supporting function that enables the models used by the app
 - *.RDS - Saved models used by the app
 - config.yml - Specifies the database connection info used by the app
 
tests - Contains tests for the app (to be covered in the course)

runloadtest.R - File that walks through the load testing exercises (to be covered in the class)

answers - Contains supporting code / outputs to be generated by the course exercises

generate_fake_student_data - Contains the code used to generate the fake data and model

provision - Contains information about the package environment used for the course



#### TODO 

- [ ] Create slower version of app (and check profvis)
- [ ] Create testable version 
- [ ] Check load test
- [ ] Create cached plot version and verify speedup
- [ ] Pull out model into plumber API / report


#### Fake ML Dataset Creation Process

Two populations: high risk, low risk created with two lookup tables:
- `high-risk-lookup-rules.csv`
- `low-risk-lookup-rules.csv`
